\description{
This data contains standardized expression for 132 miRNAs in blood for 24 
people and their percentage of blood monocytes.

The response variable (fraction of monocytes) is given by the first 
column, \code{mono}.The remaining columns, (i.e. \code{M---}) are different
blood miRNAs (the predictor variables).

This data comes from the 
[North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study](https://napls.ucsf.edu).
