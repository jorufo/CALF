\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{calfScoreAUC}: Calculate score as the area under the receivor 
operating curve; only for binary response

\item \code{calfScoreWTS}: Calculate score as the p-value from Welch's t-test; 
only for binary response

\item \code{calfScorePCC}: Calculate score as the absolute value of Pearson's 
correlation coefficient
